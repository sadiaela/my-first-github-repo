    <h2><b>Practicing Basic CSS & Github</b></h2>
    <p> Today I am going to practice css HTML,CSS, & Github all together
        for the very first time. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
        . CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Github is a web based Hosting
        service where the developers from different region can collaborate on
        project.
